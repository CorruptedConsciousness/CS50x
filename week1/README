# Week 1 – C Basics

This folder contains my work for Week 1 of Harvard’s CS50x.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Introduction to C
- Compiling with `clang`
- Variables and data types
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `else if`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do…while`)
- Basic input/output with `printf` and `get_int`

## 📝 Notes
This week makes the transition from Scratch to C.  
Key takeaways for me:

- C is strict — everything needs a type.
- Off-by-one errors are common, especially in loops.
- Debugging with `printf` helps understand program flow.
- Understanding how compilation works (source → machine code) gives insight into how low-level programming actually runs.

## 📂 Files (will be added here as I upload them)
- `hello.c`
- `mario.c` (mario-less / mario-more)
- `cash.c`

I’ll add explanations for each once the files are uploaded.
