# Week 2 – Arrays, Strings, and Cryptography

This folder contains my work for **Week 2 of Harvard’s CS50x**, where the course transitions from basic C syntax to real data structures and algorithmic thinking.

Week 2 introduces:
- arrays
- strings
- character manipulation
- ASCII values
- loop-based transformations
- the fundamentals of cryptography

## 📘 Overview

After Week 1’s introduction to C, Week 2 expands the language with data structures that store *multiple pieces of data at once*. This enables more advanced problem-solving tasks, such as analyzing text and transforming characters.

Core concepts introduced:

### ✔️ Arrays
Collections of values stored sequentially in memory.

### ✔️ Strings
Arrays of characters ending in `\0`.

### ✔️ ASCII Table
Characters expressed as numeric values.

### ✔️ Command-line arguments
Accessing user input via `argc` and `argv[]`.

### ✔️ Ciphers & Cryptography
Encrypting plaintext by shifting or substituting characters.

This week feels like the first step into “real programming”: transforming input → producing structured output.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### **1. Strings are arrays of chars**
Understanding this unlocks how loops interact with text.

### **2. Characters are numbers**
ASCII values make it possible to:
- shift letters
- wrap around the alphabet
- distinguish uppercase/lowercase

### **3. Command-line arguments change how programs receive input**
`./caesar 5`  
means that `"5"` is available inside the program through:

```c
argv[1]
