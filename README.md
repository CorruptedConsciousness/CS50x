# 🎓 Why This Repo Matters

This repository is not just code — it documents my growth as a computer science student.

Each folder contains:

- an **extended README** explaining the concepts  
- the **full programs** for each problem set  
- deep reasoning about algorithms, memory, data representation, and design  

Every commit reflects real learning, not copy/paste solutions.

# 💡 What’s Next

Next steps in this repository:

- Week 4: memory, pointers, image processing  
- Week 5: abstract data structures  
- Week 6: high-level Python solutions  
- Final CS50 project (likely something Synthrata-related)

This README will update as I continue the course.
